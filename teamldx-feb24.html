                    <br>

                    
                    <p>LDX is up and running as part of the TDX family, for this month's introduction we spoke with Joe Gradwell to get his thoughts about the new operation.</p>


                    <p>It's not every day you get the chance to develop a new business unit, but bringing the LDX and Linde partnership to life has been a fascinating, challenging - and ultimately rewarding - experience to be part of.</p>


                    <p>The launch of LDX had been brewing and started many months ago when Linde approached TDX to discuss a possible partnership. They admired the TDX values and thought they would be a great fit with Linde.</p>


                    <p>After many months of working on the agreement, the new deal was struck, and Linde AU is 100% committed to making our partnership work.</p>

            <div class="editorial  textOnly reducePadBottomMob">
                <section>


                    <h6 class="brandColor">We're privileged to have a great team at LDX, we recently got everyone together for technical training and the calibre of our personnel was clear to see.</h6>
                    <br>

                    <p>The TDX name is so highly regarded in the market, that there were more than 300 applicants for recently advertised roles (a big thanks must go to the recruitment team for their support through this process!). This demonstrates that TDX and LDX are viewed as desirable companies to work with, and we can attract high-performing candidates from within the industry. </p>
                    
                    <p>Simply, people value the TDX and LDX brands and are attracted to being part of our story.</p>

                    <p>Our brands are so renowned that, since the launch of LDX, we have received multiple approaches from significant potential customers who want to do business with us. The backing of the TDX brand adds credibility to what LDX can offer.</p>

                    <p>From a business perspective, the new LDX operation will also offer a significant advantage for TDX Group when it comes to cash flow. Material Handling/ Forklift rentals are generally five-year terms, which means income every month. After the long-term contracts finish, machines are then reallocated for shorter-term rentals.</p>

            <div class="editorial  textOnly reducePadTopMob">
                <section>     
                   
                    <p>The upshot is that there is a constant cash flow, which makes a significant and consistent contribution to the performance of the business - especially considering there are more than 300 forklifts on fully maintained service agreements currently in operation around the country which we will be picking up in the coming months from Linde AU which will provide immediate work for our teams.</p>                 

                    <p>I'd like to thank Colm for the opportunity to get LDX up and running and thank all the other people involved in bringing it to life. (Check the 'Hero a Staff Member' story for more details about someone pivotal to the project).</p>
   
                    <p>It's an exciting time to be in business, it's exciting to create a new business unit and diversify into an entirely new area complementary to TDX.</p>

                    <h6 class="brandColor">It will be an amazing year ahead for TDX and especially LDX and the new team.</h6>
                    <p>Cheers,<br> Joe.</p>

                <br>
                
                <h6>This month's 'Hero a Staff Member' features Vee MacLeod, Sustainability and Quality Manager at TDX Christchurch, and is told by Joe Gradwell.</h6>
                <br>

                <hr class="brand1">
                <br>

                <p>Vee is officially a member of the HR team, however over recent months she's been participating in a special project, assisting the new LDX business get up and running.</p>

                <p>But she's been doing more than just participating, she's literally been the glue that has held things together behind the scenes and has been a huge support to me.</p>

                <p>Anyone who knows Vee knows she has massive energy, she's not one to sit still and wait for things to happen. Her drive and determination has helped keep the project on track, coordinating elements between TDX, LDX and Linde.</p>

                <p>She has a workbook with milestones and gateways which has been the roadmap the project has followed. When it comes to hitting timelines and deadlines, Vee is the person who is across all of them and makes things happen, as and when they should.</p>

                <p>Her work ethic is admirable and has been recognised by people involved in the project from both sides of the Tasman. She puts in long hours when needed, going above and beyond the normal 9-5 routine, covering a whole variety of commitments across a number of workstreams to do with the project.</p>

               <h6>I'd like to personally thank Vee for her commitment, dedication and for helping to get LDX up and running. I have every confidence it's going to be a huge success, and a lot of this credit deserves to go to Vee for her outstanding work making it all a reality. Thank you, Vee!</h6>
