                    <br>

                    
                    <p>LDX is up and running as part of the TDX family, for this month's introduction we spoke with Joe Gradwell to get his thoughts about the new operation.</p>


                    <p>It's not every day you get the chance to develop a new business unit, but bringing the LDX and Linde partnership to life has been a fascinating, challenging - and ultimately rewarding - experience to be part of.</p>


                    <p>The launch of LDX had been brewing and started many months ago when Linde approached TDX to discuss a possible partnership. They admired the TDX values and thought they would be a great fit with Linde.</p>


                    <p>After many months of working on the agreement, the new deal was struck, and Linde AU is 100% committed to making our partnership work.</p>

                    <h6 class="brandColor">We're privileged to have a great team at LDX, we recently got everyone together for technical training and the calibre of our personnel was clear to see.</h6>
                    <br>

                    <p>The TDX name is so highly regarded in the market, that there were more than 300 applicants for recently advertised roles (a big thanks must go to the recruitment team for their support through this process!). This demonstrates that TDX and LDX are viewed as desirable companies to work with, and we can attract high-performing candidates from within the industry. Simply, people value the TDX and LDX brands and are attracted to being part of our story.</p>

                    <p>Our brands are so renowned that, since the launch of LDX, we have received multiple approaches from significant potential customers who want to do business with us. The backing of the TDX brand adds credibility to what LDX can offer.</p>

                    <p>From a business perspective, the new LDX operation will also offer a significant advantage for TDX Group when it comes to cash flow. Material Handling/ Forklift rentals are generally five-year terms, which means income every month. After the long-term contracts finish, machines are then reallocated for shorter-term rentals.</p>
                           
                    
                    <p>The upshot is that there is a constant cash flow, which makes a significant and consistent contribution to the performance of the business - especially considering there are more than 300 forklifts on fully maintained service agreements currently in operation around the country which we will be picking up in the coming months from Linde AU which will provide immediate work for our teams.</p>

                 <p>I'd like to thank Colm for the opportunity to get LDX up and running and thank all the other people involved in bringing it to life. (Check the 'Hero a Staff Member' story for more details about someone pivotal to the project).</p>

                    <p class="brandColor"><strong>I'd also like to share a couple of exciting new additions to the LDX team.</strong></p>

                    
                    <p>Millie Smyth has accepted a full-time Administrator role with LDX. Millie had been working in our TDX
Central Admin team for a wee while on a casual agreement, and then with the start of LDX
there was an opportunity to join permanently. We are very lucky that Millie has accepted a
full-time role with us, she brings with her a good understanding of TDX and how we operate
as a company, and she will now assist us as we build up the newly formed LDX.</p>

                    <p>I'd also like to introduce John Shatford as the new LDX Service Manager.<br>
John joins us from Linde Material Handling Australia, he currently runs Linde's Perth-based
service department and is looking to head back to New Zealand to be closer to his
grandchildren. John is originally from New Zealand and is looking forward to getting home.
We are extremely excited to have John join the LDX team and bring his years of experience
in the material handling space.</p>

                    

   
                    <p>It's an exciting time to be in business, it's exciting to create a new business unit and diversify into an entirely new area complementary to TDX.</p>

                    <h6 class="brandColor">It will be an amazing year ahead for TDX and especially LDX and the new team.</h6>
                    <p>Cheers,<br> Joe.</p>

                <br>

                <p>Vee is officially a member of the HR team, however over recent months she's been participating in a special project, assisting the new LDX business get up and running.</p>

                <p>But she's been doing more than just participating, she's literally been the glue that has held things together behind the scenes and has been a huge support to me.</p>

                <p>Anyone who knows Vee knows she has massive energy, she's not one to sit still and wait for things to happen. Her drive and determination has helped keep the project on track, coordinating elements between TDX, LDX and Linde.</p>

                <p>She has a workbook with milestones and gateways which has been the roadmap the project has followed. When it comes to hitting timelines and deadlines, Vee is the person who is across all of them and makes things happen, as and when they should.</p>

                <p>Her work ethic is admirable and has been recognised by people involved in the project from both sides of the Tasman. She puts in long hours when needed, going above and beyond the normal 9-5 routine, covering a whole variety of commitments across a number of workstreams to do with the project.</p>

                <br>
                
                <h6>As part of the launch of the new LDX business, we had a chat with Leigh Atallah, Director of Sales and Marketing for Linde Material Handling Australia.</h6>
                <br>
                
                <p>The term 'a match made in heaven' isn't used all that often in business, but when it comes to
                    Linde Material Handling and the new partnership with TDX and the establishment of LDX,
                    there's every reason it should be.</p>

                <p>We've been speaking with the TDX team for a number of months and have been thoroughly
                    impressed with their professionalism and dedication to getting the new business up and
                    running. However, of even greater importance and something we really respect, are the
                    synergies which exist between our two businesses - especially when it comes to our culture
                    and values.</p>

I was lucky enough to be offered the job, then 6 months later, I applied for the full-time LDX admin job and got it! 😊</p>
                    <p>I loved working for TDX, so when I was presented with the opportunity to stay on and work for LDX full-time I jumped at the chance to stay at the company and with the amazing people.</p>
                    <p> In my spare time I like to read a lot to relax. Through that reading I've picked up a few stupid little facts that I like to tell people (sometimes against their will).</p>
